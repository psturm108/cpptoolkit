# CPPToolkit

The CPP Toolkit helps C++ developers create software faster by generalizing common objectives into an
easy to use library. The library is header only making compilation easier for new developers and users.
The library uses as many POSIX libraries as possible and aims for cross-compilation on a number of
different platforms with the main focus being the Linux platform.

## Core

At the core of the library we have:

- General mathematics tools
- General architecture tools
- General input / output tools
- Image procesing algorithms
- Encryption processing tools
- Advanced hardware controllers
